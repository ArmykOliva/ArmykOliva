## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

As a young and ambitious programmer, I am currently studying electro engineering and informatics at TUM in Munich. I have extensive experience with data, algorithms, and backend development, and I love working with the Python programming language <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmnote/z-icons/master/svg/python.svg' alt='Python' height='16'>, which I have over 5 years of experience with. I am also passionate about electronics and enjoy designing electronic circuits.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1372295956771835906/btVMoJmm_400x400.png' alt='factorio Icon' height='16'>

I founded a successful ecommerce site gamergear.cz <img src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0563/4159/4311/t/5/assets/ninja.svg?v=77334596273833684201620979735' alt='gamergear Icon' height='16'>, which sells virtual reality headsets and accessories in the Czech Republic. With my technical skills, creativity, and business acumen, I bring a unique perspective and valuable contributions to any team or project I join.
