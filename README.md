## Hello there! üëã I'm Krystof

---

I'm an expert Python developer, full-stack developer, and an automation engineer with a specialized focus on AI, particularly Large Language Models. My experience ranges from creating highly automated ecommerce systems to deploying AI models and apps that redefine how companies do their work. Passionate about Virtual Reality, game development, and embedded systems. Currently, I'm extending the boundaries of AI with Large Language Models by leveraging them for various business needs, deploying GPT-4 with data security in Azure, utilizing open-source LLMs, and even devloping specially fine-tuned models for company needs. Let's dig deeper into my areas of expertise:
